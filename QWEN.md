### Codebase Structure
The project contains two main files:

### Key Technical Observations
1. **HTML Structure**: Uses semantic HTML5 elements with proper accessibility considerations
   - Navigation with links to all major sections

   - Responsive navigation that adapts for mobile

2. **CSS Features**:
   - CSS custom properties for consistent color scheme
   - Flexbox and Grid layouts
   - Responsive design with media queries
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - Modern CSS techniques like backdrop filters and gradient overlays

3. **Design Elements**:
   - Fixed navigation header
   - Full-screen hero section with background image
   - Statistics section with prominent numbers
   - Program cards with hover animations
   - Color scheme focusing on blues, greens, and yellow accents

### Responsiveness
- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Mobile navigation simplification

### Areas for Improvement
1. Image assets could be replaced with actual organization images
2. External links are currently placeholder links (#)
3. Form elements (like newsletter subscription) may need backend integration
4. Consider adding ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add JavaScript for interactive elements (slider for stories, form validation)
2. Implement backend for newsletter signup and contact forms
3. Add performance optimizations like lazy loading for images
4. Include proper meta tags for SEO
5. Add analytics tracking
